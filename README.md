# Convert PHP to ASP - php2asp

This conversion utility will not translate everything, but it will still save you a lot of time migrating from PHP to ASP. If you are brand new to ASP, and are attempting to use this tool because you don't want to learn ASP, our advice is to still get a good ASP book, as you will need to do a few manual tweaks.
